## obsidian-memo project
Hi there! 👋 \
At first, this project was just a simple automatic backup of my Obsidian files using Bash and cron — but then I decided to experiment with different types of dynamic content and API integration. \
The following sections of this README are updated on a schedule and include AI-generated content. The same goes for commit messages, which are also generated automatically.

## digital fragments: Liz's journal
hi, i'm Liz! i write code for a living and live in a city where neon spills through windows at all hours and the gentle thrum of servers feels more like home than silence

this is my journal—thoughts captured during deep focus hours when the world gets quiet and the real work begins. debugging sessions, random observations, the way my cat kiku judges my life choices, moments when the city shows its softer edges
started keeping this because days blur together too easily and i want to remember them better, make each one feel more distinct. the technical victories, the philosophical rabbit holes, the way code sometimes teaches you things about breathing... or hidden patterns in everyday chaos

mostly i write for myself, but maybe someone else will find something familiar here—the rhythm of problem-solving, the comfort of mechanical keyboards, the strange intimacy of a city that's learned to pulse with your heartbeat
welcome to the archive of small revelations 🌙

**broken screen poetry ✨**

1 AM, that recursive loop had me locked up, so i stared out the window for a break. the synth-noodles ad across the street, usually a pulsing irritant, was mostly dead.

just a grid of dark, fractured pixels. but then the cool glow from my monitors caught the faint, residual light still emanating from it. and the interplay… it wasn't static. the half-alive pixels, combined with the ambient neon, created this strange, shimmering ripple effect across the opposite building. like slow-motion water, or digital lichen blooming on concrete. my brain, exhausted from the code, just latched onto it. kiku, asleep on the vintage keyboard, didn't even stir.

it was abstract, ethereal, a quiet dance of light and shadow born from malfunction. urban decay transforming into something beautiful. sometimes the most compelling art isn't planned, it just... happens. a fleeting, accidental masterpiece 🌃

Every summer, the world's best cyclists take on one of the most gruelling athletic events in modern sports—the Tour de France. Beginning this year on July 5, the 2025 race will span 21 stages and over 3,200 kilometres across France. First held in 1903 to boost newspaper sales, the Tour has grown into cycling's most iconic race. Riders compete in mountain climbs, sprints and time trials, with the race traditionally ending in Paris.

Today's image captures the peloton navigating the Col du Tourmalet during the 2021 Tour. This mountain pass is one of the most legendary and challenging climbs, reaching 2,115 metres above sea level. Whether you're a cycling enthusiast or a casual fan, the Tour offers breathtaking scenery, fierce competition and a true test of endurance.

## natural wonder of the day
### Ha Long Bay, Vietnam
![Wonder](https://a.cdn-hotels.com/gdcs/production77/d1902/21336448-81d8-4643-a1b9-1545d08172de.jpg)

Imagine emerald waters dotted with thousands of towering limestone islands, each topped with lush rainforests – this is the breathtaking spectacle of Ha Long Bay, a true natural wonder located in northern Vietnam. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this captivating seascape was sculpted over millennia by geological forces, creating an otherworldly labyrinth of karsts that rise majestically from the sea. 

Cruising through Ha Long Bay offers an unforgettable sensory experience. You'll glide across turquoise waters under a vibrant blue sky, passing by iconic formations and hidden grottoes like Sung Sot Cave and Luon Cave. The sheer scale of the landscape is awe-inspiring, with traditional wooden boats navigating through channels that feel both intimate and expansive. For those seeking a quieter escape, nearby Lan Ha Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay offer similar beauty with fewer crowds.

The best time to witness Ha Long Bay's splendor is from October to December, when the weather is most pleasant, though be prepared for more visitors during this peak season. Booking your overnight cruise or day tour in advance is highly recommended to ensure the best experience in this magnificent bay.
