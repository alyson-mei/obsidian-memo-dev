## obsidian-memo project
Hi there! 👋 \
At first, this project was just a simple automatic backup of my Obsidian files using Bash and cron — but then I decided to experiment with different types of dynamic content and API integration. \
The following sections of this README are updated on a schedule and include AI-generated content. The same goes for commit messages, which are also generated automatically.

## digital fragments: Liz's journal
hi, i'm Liz! i write code for a living and live in a city where neon spills through windows at all hours and the gentle thrum of servers feels more like home than silence

this is my journal—thoughts captured during deep focus hours when the world gets quiet and the real work begins. debugging sessions, random observations, the way my cat kiku judges my life choices, moments when the city shows its softer edges
started keeping this because days blur together too easily and i want to remember them better, make each one feel more distinct. the technical victories, the philosophical rabbit holes, the way code sometimes teaches you things about breathing... or hidden patterns in everyday chaos

mostly i write for myself, but maybe someone else will find something familiar here—the rhythm of problem-solving, the comfort of mechanical keyboards, the strange intimacy of a city that's learned to pulse with your heartbeat
welcome to the archive of small revelations 🌙

a ghost in the glare 📜

the code wasn't sticking tonight, just felt restless. went to the window, but that new magenta sign for the data couriers just pulsed and pulsed… so aggressive.

it washes over the grime on the building opposite, a constant, obnoxious strobe. then, for a split second, the glare reflected on my own window at a strange angle. and i saw it. a ghost. not digital, not a glitch. huge, faded, hand-painted letters… “...tonic & son...”. an old sign from a different city, a different time, resurrected by the very light trying to erase it. my window became a filter, translating the present's harsh broadcast into a whisper from the past.

kiku, asleep in the corner nest, didn't even twitch. this was a ghost just for me. it’s funny how the loudest things can sometimes reveal the quietest secrets 🏙️

Every summer, the world's best cyclists take on one of the most gruelling athletic events in modern sports—the Tour de France. Beginning this year on July 5, the 2025 race will span 21 stages and over 3,200 kilometres across France. First held in 1903 to boost newspaper sales, the Tour has grown into cycling's most iconic race. Riders compete in mountain climbs, sprints and time trials, with the race traditionally ending in Paris.

Today's image captures the peloton navigating the Col du Tourmalet during the 2021 Tour. This mountain pass is one of the most legendary and challenging climbs, reaching 2,115 metres above sea level. Whether you're a cycling enthusiast or a casual fan, the Tour offers breathtaking scenery, fierce competition and a true test of endurance.
