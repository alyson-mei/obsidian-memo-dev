## obsidian-memo project
Hi there! 👋 \
At first, this project was just a simple automatic backup of my Obsidian files using Bash and cron — but then I decided to experiment with different types of dynamic content and API integration. \
The following sections of this README are updated on a schedule and include AI-generated content. The same goes for commit messages, which are also generated automatically.

## digital fragments: Liz's journal
hi, i'm Liz! i write code for a living and live in a city where neon spills through windows at all hours and the gentle thrum of servers feels more like home than silence

this is my journal—thoughts captured during deep focus hours when the world gets quiet and the real work begins. debugging sessions, random observations, the way my cat kiku judges my life choices, moments when the city shows its softer edges
started keeping this because days blur together too easily and i want to remember them better, make each one feel more distinct. the technical victories, the philosophical rabbit holes, the way code sometimes teaches you things about breathing... or hidden patterns in everyday chaos

mostly i write for myself, but maybe someone else will find something familiar here—the rhythm of problem-solving, the comfort of mechanical keyboards, the strange intimacy of a city that's learned to pulse with your heartbeat
welcome to the archive of small revelations 🌙

### 29 jun 2025 
the city in my hands 📡

2 am, and the warmth of the thinking mug felt... different tonight. not just the jasmine tea inside. a faint, high-frequency buzz against my palms, a subtle vibration i almost dismissed as tired nerves.

then i saw it. the network diagnostics on my secondary monitor, a massive data spike from a municipal relay lighting up the graph like a silent firework. and the cheap ceramic in my hands pulsed right along with it, a distinct electronic purr that faded in perfect time with the graph's descent. the glaze, the tiny impurities... it's a crude antenna.

my little symbol of quiet, of solo walks and solitary thought, has been listening to the city’s chaotic chatter this whole time. kiku, asleep in a nest of discarded cables, didn't even stir. this frequency is just for me.

all this time i thought this mug was my escape from the noise, but it's just translating it into a language i can feel 🤔

### The Milky Way over Horse Head Rock, New South Wales, Australia
![Bing](https://img.peapix.com/79ceb87e94454c91a20979e2bec705b8_1080.jpg)

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink—unless, of course, you're talking about Horse Head Rock, perched off the Sapphire Coast near Bermagui in New South Wales, Australia. This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.

Bermagui, about 380 kilometres south of Sydney, sits under Gulaga, also known as Mount Dromedary. Gulaga is a sacred mountain for the Yuin peoples, an Australian Aboriginal group, who call it Mother Mountain. This area is also home to other highlights, like Camel Rock, Wallaga Lake, the Bermagui Blue Pool and Mimosa Rocks National Park. Wildlife is abundant too—keep an eye out for migrating whales, playful dolphins and soaring sea eagles as you explore the coastline.

## natural wonder of the day
### Marble Caves, Patagonia, Chile
![Wonder](https://www.mostbeautifulspots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Marble-Caves-Lago-Carrera-Chile-Victor-Thomann-1800x1200.jpg)

Imagine a world where liquid sapphire meets sculpted alabaster, where the very essence of water has painstakingly carved art from stone. Welcome to the Marble Caves, or Capillas de Mármol, a breathtaking natural wonder nestled in the heart of Chilean Patagonia.

These mesmerizing formations are found on Lago General Carrera, also known as Lago Buenos Aires, a vast glacial lake. For over 6,000 years, the relentless lapping of freshwater waves has sculpted intricate tunnels and caverns from a marble peninsula, revealing stunning swirling patterns on the smooth calcium carbonate walls. What makes them truly unique are the vibrant reflections of the lake's turquoise waters, which dance and shift across the marble, creating an ethereal glow that changes with every ripple.

Visiting the Marble Caves is an unforgettable sensory experience. As you glide through the serene waters by boat or kayak, you'll witness the harmonious blend of vivid blue and white marble, feeling dwarfed by the sheer scale of nature's artistry. The light filtering from above illuminates the cavernous spaces, highlighting the detailed artistry of geological time. The best way to fully appreciate this natural masterpiece is by taking a guided tour, allowing you to navigate deep into the sculpted grottoes and witness their shifting beauty up close. While specific seasons aren't mentioned as optimal, the clear waters and light conditions are key to experiencing their full splendor.
