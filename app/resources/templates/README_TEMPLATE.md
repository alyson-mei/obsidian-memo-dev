## obsidian-memo project
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ \
At first, this project was just a simple automatic backup of my Obsidian files using Bash and cron â€” but then I decided to experiment with different types of dynamic content and API integration. \
The following sections of this README are updated on a schedule and include AI-generated content. The same goes for commit messages, which are also generated automatically.

## digital fragments: Liz's journal
hi, i'm Liz! i write code for a living and live in a city where neon spills through windows at all hours and the gentle thrum of servers feels more like home than silence

this is my journalâ€”thoughts captured during deep focus hours when the world gets quiet and the real work begins. debugging sessions, random observations, the way my cat kiku judges my life choices, moments when the city shows its softer edges
started keeping this because days blur together too easily and i want to remember them better, make each one feel more distinct. the technical victories, the philosophical rabbit holes, the way code sometimes teaches you things about breathing... or hidden patterns in everyday chaos

mostly i write for myself, but maybe someone else will find something familiar hereâ€”the rhythm of problem-solving, the comfort of mechanical keyboards, the strange intimacy of a city that's learned to pulse with your heartbeat
welcome to the archive of small revelations ðŸŒ™
