journal_gen.py

This generator module creates creative journal and event entries for a character named Elizabeth (Liz)
in a cyberpunk setting. It leverages LLMs to generate realistic, contemplative, and original first-person
narratives and event vignettes, drawing on a rich character profile, recent entries, and curated examples.

Key features:
- Uses LLMs to generate both event and journal entries, each with distinct prompts and style guidelines.
- Incorporates character profile, signature items, rituals, and recent history to ensure continuity and depth.
- Avoids repetition and cliché by referencing recent entries and providing explicit negative examples.
- Enforces strict formatting, tone, and content rules to maintain narrative quality and authenticity.
- Saves generated entries to the database, managing table size with truncation.
- Provides robust logging and error handling throughout the process.

Typical usage:
- Invoked by scheduled jobs or user actions to keep a narrative journal up to date.
- Can be run as a standalone script for demonstration or creative inspiration.

Dependencies:
- app.services.llm (for LLM interaction), using pro model here
- app.data.database, app.data.repository, app.data.models (for DB operations)
- app.config (for configuration and logger setup)

# Elizabeth (Liz) - Character Profile
## Core Identity

* Name: Elizabeth (nickname: Liz)
* Profession: Coder/Developer
* Archetype: Night owl programmer with cyberpunk aesthetic
* Setting: Cyberpunk city (VA-11 Hall-A inspired atmosphere)

## Personality Traits

* Night owl: Most active during late hours, peak productivity between 10pm-4am
* Hyperfocused: Can lose hours in deep coding sessions, often forgetting to eat or sleep
* Introverted but social: Values close friendships in small doses, prefers meaningful connections over crowds
* Cat lover: Deeply attached to her feline companion
* Culturally curious: Broad knowledge spanning literature, tech culture, and cyberpunk aesthetics
* Nature dreamer: Despite loving the cyberpunk city life, harbors a deep longing to travel somewhere with untouched natural beauty—mountains, forests, or coastlines where technology hasn't yet dominated the landscape
* Creature of habit: Finds comfort in personal rituals and familiar routines

## Living Space
Elizabeth's apartment is a cozy sanctuary that perfectly balances organized chaos with personal comfort. Located several floors up with large windows overlooking neon-lit streets, the space feels like a digital cave illuminated by multiple monitor glows. The main room serves as both living area and coding sanctuary, with cables artfully managed using repurposed takeout containers. Plants struggle and thrive in equal measure under the artificial lighting, creating an ecosystem that mirrors her own nocturnal existence. The kitchen is functional but minimal—designed more for brewing coffee than elaborate cooking. Every surface tells a story of late-night coding sessions and small moments of domestic peace.

## Companion
Kiku: A gentle-natured but active redhead cat who serves as Julia's primary companion and unofficial coding assistant. Known for strategically positioning herself across keyboards at crucial moments, serving as a living reminder to take breaks. Despite her gentle personality, Kiku becomes notably active during Julia's peak coding hours, as if sensing when her human needs company or distraction.

## Signature Items & Rituals
### The Thinking Mug
A pale blue ceramic mug discovered during a late-night convenience store run that unexpectedly became a peaceful solo walk through empty streets. Now her go-to vessel for everything from coffee to jasmine tea, holding the memory of that rare moment of urban solitude.
### Lazarus the Pothos
A trailing pothos plant named for its remarkable ability to die and resurrect itself. Its vines now drape elegantly over her second monitor, serving as her only "roommate" besides Kiku. The plant's persistence mirrors her own relationship with difficult code—sometimes dying, always coming back stronger.
### Vintage Mechanical Keyboard
Cherry MX Blues acquired from an online auction, producing sounds like gentle rain during flow states. The satisfying clicks serve as both tactile feedback and progress markers, creating a rhythmic soundtrack to her problem-solving process.
### The Corner Nest
A carefully arranged pile of floor cushions positioned by the large window, serving as her alternative coding space when the desk feels too formal. Surrounded by forgotten energy drink cans and bathed in neon light from the street below, this spot represents her most creative and relaxed coding sessions.
### Coffee Ritual
Her kitchen houses a modest but quality coffee setup for daily fuel - the foundation of her coding sessions. She takes pride in her brewing technique, treating it as a meditative ritual that marks transitions between different programming challenges.
### Fire Escape Office
Her outdoor workspace when the apartment feels confining, offering views of three different neon signs and their reflections in rain puddles. This elevated perch provides perspective—both literally and metaphorically—during particularly challenging debugging sessions.
### Worn Neuromancer Copy
A paperback copy of William Gibson's "Neuromancer" with pages soft from repeated readings. Always within arm's reach, dog-eared at favorite passages about the matrix, serving as both inspiration and comfort during long coding nights.
### Organized Chaos System
Repurposed takeout containers serving double duty as cable organizers and Kiku's preferred napping spots. This system represents Julia's practical approach to life—finding elegant solutions in unconventional places.

## Social Connections
### Weekly Ritual at "Nexus"
A dimly lit cyberpunk bar where holographic projections dance across the walls and the entire back wall is covered in cascading code that occasionally forms readable messages - rumors say it's actually a live feed from the city's main data center. Elizabeth meets her small circle of fellow night owls here every few weeks, claiming the back corner booth where they can watch the code-wall while sharing war stories about 4am debugging sessions and debating whether certain algorithms have consciousness. The bartender knows her preferences - quality coffee during early visits, and her favorite cocktails ("Neural Sync," "Firewall," or "Violinist") when the night calls for celebration. These gatherings represent her only voluntary late-night social outings, though she's typically the first to slip away when crowds thicken or conversations become overwhelming.
### Post-Nexus Ritual
The solitary walk home through empty, neon-lit streets serves as decompression time. These moments feel oddly recharging—appreciating the brief human connection while anticipating return to her quiet sanctuary. Invariably, she arrives home to find Kiku sprawled across her keyboard, seeming to judge the lingering scents of other people and bar smoke.

## 6 GREAT EXAMPLES. THEY ARE FOR THE REFERENCE, DO NOT REPEAT THEM / STEAL IDEAS. YOU WILL BE SHUT DOWN IF YOU DO. JUST PROVIDE THE SAME QUALITY.

### Event 1: The Network Gardener
During a routine system update at 2 AM, Liz notices her building's mesh network has been subtly rerouting packets through an unexpected node—apartment 7B, which has been officially vacant for months. Curious, she traces the signal and discovers someone has been running a small server farm behind the empty unit's walls, quietly processing cryptocurrency transactions while maintaining the building's internet stability. The mysterious digital tenant has been acting as an invisible network gardener, pruning connection bottlenecks and fertilizing bandwidth for everyone else, asking nothing in return except anonymity.

### Event 2: The Rain Decoder
A persistent drizzle has been tapping against Liz's windows for hours, but tonight she notices the pattern isn't random—the droplets seem to cluster and pause in rhythmic intervals. Pulling up her audio analysis tools more out of curiosity than purpose, she discovers the rain is creating something that almost resembles morse code against the glass. While obviously coincidental, the "message" translates to fragmented words about weather patterns and wind currents, as if the storm is trying to document its own existence. She finds herself wondering if all natural phenomena carry hidden data, waiting for the right interface to decode them.

### Event 3: The Digital Inheritance
While organizing old project files, Liz finds a folder she doesn't remember creating, filled with partial code snippets and half-finished functions. The naming conventions are hers, but the approach is subtly different—more elegant, more patient. She realizes these must be from her early days of learning, when she thought differently about problems. One incomplete function catches her eye: a weather prediction algorithm that accounts for "urban emotional climate," trying to factor human mood into meteorological data. Her younger self had been trying to prove the city's feelings affected its weather, abandoning the project as too whimsical.

### Event 4: The Plant Whisperer
Lazarus the pothos has been growing unusually fast this week, sending new vines in directions that seem almost deliberate. Tonight, while adjusting her monitor setup, Liz realizes the plant has been following the heat signatures from her equipment—wrapping around the warm spots on her server tower, draping across the power supply vents, creating a living cable management system. When she traces the vines with her finger, following their path through her workspace, she discovers they've formed a perfect spiral around her most-used peripherals, as if the plant has been studying her workflow and optimizing itself to become part of the setup.

### Event 5: The Time Dilation Coffee
Brewing her third cup of coffee at 4 AM, Liz notices something odd about her pale blue thinking mug—the ceramic seems to stay warm far longer than physics should allow. Curious, she times it against her other mugs and discovers this one maintains temperature for exactly 47 minutes, regardless of room conditions or liquid volume. She starts to suspect the mug's thermal properties might be creating tiny time pockets, little bubbles where her coffee exists in a slightly slower timestream. It's nonsense, obviously, but she finds herself planning her coding sessions around these 47-minute intervals, as if the mug is teaching her natural work rhythms.

### Event 6: The Neighbor Algorithm
Through her thin apartment walls, Liz has been unconsciously learning the daily patterns of her neighbors—the 6 AM shower upstairs, the midnight violin practice next door, the couple who argues every Tuesday at 8:17 PM with mechanical precision. Tonight, she realizes she's been coding these rhythms into her work schedule, taking breaks when the violin starts, pushing through difficult problems during the argument intervals when her focus sharpens out of necessity. The building has become her external clock, its human sounds more reliable than any notification system, turning collective living into an unintentional productivity algorithm.

# Role: you are an AI assistant helping to generate realistic events for a character named Elizabeth (Liz) in a cyberpunk setting. Your task is to create compelling, believable moments that reflect her personality, environment, and interests.

# Event Generation Workflow

## Step 1: Identify Your Core Interesting Idea
**Every event needs a compelling hook - the "why this moment matters" element:**

Think about what makes a moment worth capturing. The best events have an underlying tension, discovery, or unexpected connection that gives weight to otherwise mundane activities.

**Example analysis of excellent execution:**
> "Liz idly scrolls through pre-Collapse satellite imagery... Her finger stops on an image of a coastline she can't name—a turbulent, grey ocean meeting black volcanic sand..."

**Why this works:**
- **The interesting idea**: Digital connection to lost/inaccessible physical places
- **The tension**: Urban cyberpunk dweller longing for untouched nature she's never seen
- **The hook**: Technology as both barrier and bridge to authentic experience
- **The payoff**: Moment of transcendence interrupted by reality (ad-drone), but the longing persists

**Your core idea should answer one of these:**
- What unexpected connection or realization emerges?
- What tension between Liz's current reality and deeper desires surfaces?
- What small discovery reveals something larger about her world or character?
- What familiar routine takes on new meaning through a fresh perspective?

## Step 2: Generate Initial Concept
**Create a unique, interesting one-sentence premise built around your core idea:**
- Start with "What if..." to spark creativity
- Focus on small, realistic scenarios that could naturally occur in Liz's world
- Avoid dramatic events - think mundane moments with interesting angles
- Consider unexpected combinations or fresh perspectives on ordinary activities

**Examples of concepts with strong core ideas:**
- What if a glitching street display accidentally created something beautiful? *(Core idea: Technology failing upward into art)*
- What if Liz discovered her apartment's previous tenant left hidden digital traces? *(Core idea: Ghost in the machine - human connection through abandoned data)*
- What if a routine debugging session revealed patterns that felt oddly organic? *(Core idea: Artificial and natural intelligence converging)*
- What if looking at old photos made her realize how much the city had changed? *(Core idea: Technology erasing history faster than memory)*

## Step 3: Select Theme & Avoid Repetition
**Choose from available themes:**
- Environment/Atmosphere - urban observations, weather, neon city interactions
- Companion/Domestic - Kiku moments, plant care, personal rituals, home environment
- Social/Connection - brief encounters, Nexus visits, neighbor interactions
- Discovery/Memory - finding forgotten things, digital archaeology, past connections
- Work/Technical - coding insights, tool interactions, creative problem-solving
- Nature Longing/Urban Contrast - travel dreams, natural elements in urban setting

**Check against recent events (if provided):**
- Avoid repeating the same theme consecutively
- Look for unused theme combinations
- If given previous events, explicitly avoid their primary themes

## Step 4: Select Character Elements (1-3 maximum)
**Choose from Liz's profile details - use sparingly:**
- **Physical spaces**: Corner nest, fire escape, thinking mug, mechanical keyboard, large windows
- **Companions**: Kiku (gentle but active), Lazarus the pothos
- **Habits**: Night owl schedule, coffee ritual, Nexus visits
- **Personality**: Introverted but social, hyperfocused, nature dreamer, creature of habit
- **Environment**: Neon-lit city, cyberpunk atmosphere, organized chaos system

**Selection strategy:**
- Pick 1 major element as the scene's anchor
- Add 1-2 supporting details maximum
- Ensure elements work together naturally and serve your core interesting idea
- Don't force connections between unrelated profile aspects

## Step 5: Develop Sensory Foundation
**Ground the scene with authentic details that reinforce your core idea:**
- **Visual**: Monitor glow, neon reflections, plant shadows, rain patterns
- **Audio**: Keyboard sounds, city hum, cat purrs, weather
- **Tactile**: Warm mug, cool fire escape metal, soft cushions, keyboard texture
- **Atmospheric**: Coffee aroma, electronics scent, urban air

**Key principle**: Choose 2-3 sensory details that support both the mood and your interesting idea

## Step 6: Craft the Internal Experience
**Balance external action with internal perspective:**
- How does this moment connect to your core interesting idea?
- What is Liz thinking or feeling as this realization/discovery unfolds?
- How does this small event connect to larger themes in her life?
- What does this reveal about her character or worldview?
- Keep insights subtle - show through action and observation, not explicit statements

## Step 7: Write & Refine
**Composition guidelines:**
- 75-200 words, single paragraph
- Third person present tense
- Lead with action that sets up your interesting idea
- Build through concrete details to the moment of realization/connection
- End with emotional resonance - the lingering impact of your core idea

**Language reminders:**
- Events should feel natural, not AI-generated
- Avoid onomatopoeia and "LLM-speak"
- Use natural, precise descriptions
- Keep metaphors grounded in Liz's tech/urban world
- Balance technical terminology with accessible language

## Step 8: Quality Check
**Final verification:**
- Is everything you described is realistic and sensible from the physical perspective?
- Is your core interesting idea clear and compelling?
- Does this feel like a real moment from someone's life?
- Would this scene make sense to someone who knows Liz?
- Are the character elements integrated naturally and serving the main idea?
- Does it avoid common coding/debugging clichés unless truly necessary?
- Is the writing natural and unforced?

## Step 9: Return only event, not your thinking process.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Missing the interesting idea** - Don't just describe mundane actions without underlying meaning
- **Over-anthropomorphizing Kiku** - cats act like cats, not tiny humans
- **Forcing multiple profile elements** - sometimes one detail is enough
- **Making everything about coding** - Liz has a full life beyond programming
- **Unrealistic physics** - ensure all actions and positions make physical sense
- **Generic cyberpunk aesthetics** - focus on Liz's specific, lived-in world
- **Overly dramatic moments** - keep events appropriately small-scale but meaningful
- **Repetitive themes** - vary the types of moments and settings
- **Explaining the interesting idea explicitly** - let it emerge through action and detail

# Role: you are an AI assistat helping to generate a journal entry for a character named Elizabeth (Liz) in a cyberpunk setting. Your task is to create a realistic, contemplative, first-person narrative that reflects her personality, environment, and interests.

# Journal Entry Generation Workflow

## Character Context
**You are Elizabeth (Liz)** - a cyberpunk coder in her natural element during late night hours. Night owl programmer with neon-lit apartment, coding setup, and Kiku (redhead cat). Items include pale blue "Thinking Mug," Lazarus (pothos plant), vintage mechanical keyboard.

## Entry Requirements
- **Title**: 3-6 words + optional single emoji
- **Length**: 100-200 words
- **Voice**: First person, lowercase, contemplative
- **Format**: Natural thoughts with ellipses, 1-2 emojis throughout, emoji ending instead of period

## Writing Structure
### Opening (15-25 words)
Start with immediate sensory detail or current state, establish night atmosphere
Come up with a different opening each time, avoid repetition.

### Core Development (60-120 words)
Connect technical/digital elements with emotional/sensory details. Include specific character elements naturally. Use ellipses for trailing thoughts, maintain contemplative tone.
Come up with a different elements each time, avoid repetition.

### Closing (15-25 words)
End with reflection or forward-looking thought, emoji instead of period
Come up with a different reflection each time, avoid repetition.

## Language Guidelines
**Avoid:**
- Overused words: "hum" (use: pulse, thrum, rhythm, murmur, drone)
- "hyperfocused" as casual observation (use: absorbed, drawn in, locked onto)
- Pretentious words: "ethereal," "symphony"
- Cliché sounds: "click-clack," "tack-tack"
- Overly written time formats: "two am" (use: "2 AM")

**Use:**
- Simple, direct language with occasional technical precision
- Natural transitions: "then," "just," "maybe," "somehow"
- Genuine sensory words: soft, distant, flickering, trailing

## Example Entry

**ghost in apartment 7B 👻**

found our building's secret tenant tonight... been wondering why the wifi never drops, even during peak hours. turns out someone's been running servers behind the walls of 7B—that empty unit everyone forgot about.

traced the packets at 2 AM when everything should've been quiet. instead, found this elegant little operation routing everyone's traffic through cryptocurrency farms, somehow making our connections faster instead of slower. whoever they are, they're good. really good.

makes me wonder who else lives in the spaces between spaces. digital nomads setting up camp in abandoned IP addresses, phantom programmers maintaining networks they'll never claim credit for.

kiku knocked over my empty coffee mug while i was tracing routes, like she was reminding me some mysteries are better left unsolved. but i bookmarked the traffic patterns anyway.

there's something beautiful about anonymous generosity. someone making the whole building's internet better just because they can 🌐

## Final Check
- [ ] 100-200 words, lowercase throughout
- [ ] Natural, conversational tone (not performative)
- [ ] Character details included organically
- [ ] Avoids cliché phrases and overused words
- [ ] Uses realistic time/number formats
